# Weather App
A minimalistic weather web-app made using **Reactjs**, **tailwindcss** (with a little bit of backend  ><).

### How to use it?
Easy peezy, open the website, enter the name of the place (city/town) and boom, you get-
- the current temperature
- brief description of the current weather
- wind speed
- humidity

**P.S** - I made this while learning react to test my skills
